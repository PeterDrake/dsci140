# Overview

This is the first part of the team project. Over the course of the semester, your team will find, analyze, visualize, and present data on a research question of your choice.

**This is a team assignment. When you are done:**
* ***One* member of your team should submit the file, including (as a comment at the top of the file) the names of everyone who contributed.**
* **Everyone else should turn in an empty assignment on Google Classroom, including a comment about who turned in the document for your team.**

# Process
First, each member of the team should *independently* write down five potential topics. If you're coming up blank, looking through available data sources can help. Here are a couple of places to look:
* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
* [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Now, with your team, agree on five topics that you think would be good options to explore. Here are some questions to think about:

* Is everyone interested in this topic? You're going to be spending a lot of time on it, so you don't want to be bored. Make sure everyone on your team is involved in the discussion; practice active listening.
* What unanswered questions do you have about this topic? The point of research is to find answers, not to verify what you already know or believe. If different members of the team have different beliefs about the topic, that's fantastic!
* Can data shed light on these questions?

# What to Hand in
***One member of your team*** should hand in a single document listing your five topics, along with any related explanation. Include the ***full names*** of everyone who worked on it.

***Everyone else*** should turn in an empty assignment on Google Classroom, including a comment about who turned in the document for your team.
