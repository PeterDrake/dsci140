# Data Diary Phase 2: Data Dictionary
* Refine your list of variables to 6-7 that best “model” a day in your life right now
* Construct a [data dictionary](https://help.osf.io/article/217-how-to-make-a-data-dictionary) with the following fields for your model ([sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rEd-c7J7ziIW1NcfI9PnWER3nHKjrmu6N35RU9VlxUY/edit?usp=sharing)):
  * Name of Variable
  * Justification for Inclusion in final model
  * Unit of Measure
  * Measurement Methodology
  * Justification for Measurement (Unit & Methodology)

Your data dictionary should be sufficient such that someone else could apply your model.

Here are a couple examples of [data dictionaries](https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-dictionary#:~:text=In%20the%20widely%20used%20data,information%20on%20each%20data%20element.) in the real world: [1](https://tes-sfa.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/Soil_C_Decomp_Data_Dictionary_20140616.pdf), [2](https://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/sandiego/data/gis/dem/ned13/NED_DataDictionary.pdf).

## What to Hand in
Make sure your workbook (including the data dictionary) is shared with both me (drake@lclark.edu) and Parvaneh (parvaneh@lclark.edu). Also turn it in via Google Classroom.
