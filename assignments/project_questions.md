# Overview

This is the second part of the team project. With your team, answer the questions below.

**This is a team assignment. When you are done:**
* ***One* member of your team should submit the file, including (as a comment at the top of the file) the names of everyone who contributed.**
* **Everyone else should turn in an empty assignment on Google Classroom, including a comment about who turned in the document for your team.**

# Research Questions
1. What is your population or group of interest? (For example, it might be "US citizens", "trees in Oregon", or "cars currently manufactured worldwide".)
2. What questions do you have about this population or group?
3. What variables are relevant to your research question? How might someone gather this information?
4. Who might have gathered the data you need? You don't need to find it yet, just speculate about who might have gathered it. There should be more than one source.

Note that:
* If you could find the answer with a simple web search, the question is not a good one for this project.
* The answers to your questions should depend on the data. You should be using data to answer questions to which you don't already know the answer, not merely to support a claim that you already know or believe to be true.

# What to Hand in
***One member of your team*** should hand in a single document answering all four questions. Include the ***full names*** of everyone who worked on it.

***Everyone else*** should turn in an empty assignment on Google Classroom, including a comment about who turned in the document for your team.
