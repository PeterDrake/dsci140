# Data Diary Phase 1: Variable Brainstorming

****This is an individual assignment. You are meant to do the writing on your own. You are welcome to discuss *ideas* with other students (including on the class email list), but don't look at their spreadsheet or show them yours.****

1. Imagine myriad ways that you could quantify a day of your life.  
2. Identify at least 12 variables and specify the units of measure for each. Record them in *a copy of* [the template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DZY-98woiSpLB0KqlAWDhEhGt43QmQ0-ECNtq2VpCW8/edit?usp=sharing). 
3. Each of the variables must be measurable by you (or equipment you own).
4. Compile your list in a Google sheet, similar to the model shared, and have it ready to share with a classmate on Monday, February 9th 
5. Use your imagination and whimsy, this assignment is about you and your life.  What are the things that shape, inspire, and mark your day? 
6. Phase II of this assignment will continue from Monday.

## What to Hand in

There's nothing to hand in for this one. Just have your spreadsheet ready for Monday.
