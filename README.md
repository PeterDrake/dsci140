## Overview
Data science is the study of extracting knowledge from data, enabling us to better understand and make decisions about our world. It lies at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and expertise in some particular domain. This course will empower you with the foundational skills necessary to solve problems with data.

No previous programming or statistical experience is assumed.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
* Demonstrate basic proficiency with a spreadsheet
  * Load, enter, and modify data
  * Use formulas and pivot tables to produce derived data
* Demonstrate basic proficiency with the Python programming language
  * Run, read, debug, and write simple programs
  * Use control structures such as if/else statements and loops
  * Use variables to name and manipulate objects
  * Call, test, and define functions to encapsulate computations
* Identify, understand, and manipulate various data types and structures
  * Read from and write to text, CSV, and JSON files
  * Use operations specific to numbers, strings, and dates
  * Manipulate Python data structures including lists, NumPy arrays, and Pandas dataframes
* Demonstrate proficiency  in data visualization
  * Produce a variety of charts
  * Follow best practices for clarity, accuracy, and accessibility 
* Recognize and adjust for data's context in the real world
  * Discuss issues in measuring physical and social variables, including sampling
  * Describe and compensate for sources of bias
  * Clean datasets to deal with missing or misformatted data
  * Use tables, visualizations, and text to tell persuasive data-centered stories
* Apply descriptive methods to summarize data and identify relationships
  * Choose and compute appropriate summary statistics (measures of central tendency and dispersion)
  * Compute correlations and explain the relationship between correlation and causality

## Course Structure

There are three major sections to the course:
* Working with data using a spreadsheet (Google Sheets)
* Introduction to programming with Python
* Working with data using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas

The major components of the course are:
* Individual assignments that you are meant to complete on your own. You are welcome to help each other with *concepts*, but any code, writing, math, etc. should be your own.
* Team projects that you complete with a team of 3-4 students.

There are no exams. In place of a final exam, teams will present their final projects.

## Schedule

Flex days are days for you to work on assignments in class. They also serve as a reserve in case of getting behind,
instructor illness, inclement weather, etc.
