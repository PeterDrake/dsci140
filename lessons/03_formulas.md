# Formulas
* You can find a Google Sheet or import a xlsx, ods, or csv file
* Open NEED EXAMPLE HERE
* `=2+2`
  * Note difference between the formula and the value it computes
  * Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`
  * Comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>`
    * `<>` means "not equal to"
* Referring to an existing cell
  * It's automatically updated when the data changes
  * References are changed when you copy to another cell
  * Absolute vs relative references
    * F4 to toggle variations
* Getting the sum of a range with `SUM`
* `COUNT`
  * Challenge: compute average using these two
  * `COUNT` returns the number of *numeric* values
  * `COUNTA` returns the number of non-blank cells
* `AVERAGE` and `MAX`
* `RANDOM`
  * It's updated any time you edit anything
  * Copy and paste values
* `IF`
* Nesting formulas
* `VLOOKUP(A2, $B$10:$C$15`, 2, FALSE)
  * Looks for whatever is in A2
  * Looks in the first column of the specified range
  * Returns the corresponding value in column 2 (relative, 1-based) within the range
  * You always want FALSE
    * TRUE is an "approximate match" and assumes the data are sorted
