# Sampling
* 1936 Presidential poll by The Literary Digest
  * Incorrectly predicted that Alfred Landon would defeat incumbent Franklin Roosevelt in a landslide.
  * The magazine sent out 10 million postcards. Over 2 million people responded.
  * The addresses were drawn from the magazine's own subscription list, a list of car owners, and a list of telephone owners.
  * The survey was biased in favor of wealthier voters, who favored Landon.
* Population vs sample
* Parameter (population) vs statistic (sample)
* Exercises
  * What are the population, sample, parameter, and statistic for this survey?
    * "54% of those surveyed reported that they already have been vaccinated, or will get vaccinated as soon as they are allowed."
  * Are these parameters or statistics?
    * "A recent survey by the alumni of a major university indicated that the average salary of 10,000 of its 300,000 graduates was $125,000."
    * "The average salary of all assembly-line employees at a certain car manufacturer is $33,000."
    * "In the Oregon House of Representatives, 63% of the representatives are Democrats."
* The best sample is a *simple random sample*.
  * Each individual in the population is equally likely to be chosen.
* TPS: Is this a simple random sample?
  * "A research scientist is interested in studying the experiences of twins raised together versus those raised apart. She obtains a list of twins from the National Twin Registry, and selects two subsets of individuals for her study. First, she chooses all those in the registry whose last name begins with Z. Then she turns to all those whose last name begins with B. Because there are so many names that start with B, however, our researcher decides to incorporate only every other name into her sample. Finally, she mails out a survey and compares characteristics of twins raised apart versus together."
* Discuss: How might you take a simple random sample when you don't have a list of the entire population?
  * Stratified sampling

# Bias
* Sources of bias
  * Sampling bias
  * Response bias
  * Survivorship bias
  * Loaded questions (push polls)
  * Conflict of interest (on part of respondents or researchers)
  * Do you know of others from your own disciplines?
